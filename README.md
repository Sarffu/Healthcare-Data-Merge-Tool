This tool automates the process of updating Excel spreadsheets. It intelligently combines provider information and dates from two different files. The core function is to update "Provider Effective Date" entries only when an NPI matches and the corresponding status is 'Approved'. Importantly, any dates updated by an 'Approved' status are automatically highlighted in the final output. This simplifies your data management, making it quicker and more accurate.
